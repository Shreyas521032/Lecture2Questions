## üìä IF-TDF Implementation

Our custom Inverse Frequency - Term Document Frequency implementation:

```python
def calculate_if_tdf(content):
    """
    Calculate IF-TDF weights for document terms
    """
    # Preprocess content
    terms = preprocess_text(content)

    # Calculate term frequencies
    tf = Counter(terms)

    # Calculate inverse document frequency
    idf = {term: log(len(documents)/(doc_freq[term]+1)) for term in tf}

    # Combine using IF-TDF formula
    if_tdf = {term: (1/tf[term]) * idf[term] for term in tf}

    return sorted(if_tdf.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

This helps in:
- Identifying key concepts from documents
- Prioritizing important terms for question generation
- Reducing bias towards common words
